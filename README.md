# Numberfit Tech Test

The code provided in the file ```main.py``` is a Python 3 script which takes in command line arguments to output a plot in matplotlib which looks similar to the image sent in the tech test.

Now I have used Python, due to my familiarity with it. The job description lists Node.js experience, I have some experience in coding in Node.js and have created a couple of IoT Alexa voice skills using Node.js, but by no means is it my strongest language. This however does not mean I am not keen to learn it, as I have an aptitude for picking up new langauges and frameworks very quickly.

### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python 3 installed and two particular packages - numpy and matplotlib.

If you do not have these packages installed, they can be installed through the package manager pip. In a console window type ```pip install --user numpy``` and ```pip install --user matplotlib```. The ```--user``` option alleviates minor issues that occur on the windows platform.

### How to run:
Once all prerequisites are filled, navigate to the directory where you have saved the Python script. In a terminal window run the following command ```python main.py [arg1] [arg2] [arg3]```.

The arguements that are required are:
- ```arg1``` = walk
-  ```arg2``` = cycle
- ```arg1``` = car

An example of a successful command is ```python main.py 4 1 3```. This will create a png file, and save it in the same location as the Python script with the name ```maths_equation.png```. Everytime the script is run, it will override the previous image file.

If there is anything else, please don't hesitate to bring it up in the interview or email/phone me beforehand.
